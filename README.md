# The Origami family of smart contracts

[![CI](https://github.com/JoinOrigami/crane/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JoinOrigami/crane/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Synopsis of contracts

| Contract                    | Purpose                                                       |
| :---------------------------| :-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OrigamiMembershipToken`    | A membership NFT issued to DAO members                        |
| `OrigamiGovernanceToken`    | An ERC20 token appropriate for use in governance              |
| `OrigamiGovernorDiamond`    | The EIP-2535 Diamond interface to the governor facets         |
| `OrigamiTimelockController` | Part of a given DAO's governor deploy                         |
| `AccessControl`             | A re-implementation of OZ AccessControl using Diamond Storage |

### Governor Implementation

A Governor instance is deployed as an [EIP-2535 Diamond](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535), with the facet deploys being reusable implementations. The facets and their supporting files can be found in `src/governor`.

## Development

We power our solidity development with `foundry`. The [book](https://book.getfoundry.sh) is a great jumping off point. [Awesome Foundry](https://github.com/crisgarner/awesome-foundry) does a great job of showcasing common patterns implemented using `foundry`. Run `forge` from the project directory after installing the prerequisites to get an idea of the capabilities.

### Pre Requisites

1. Install `cargo`: `curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`
2. Install `foundry` ([instructions and details](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)):
   - `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`
   - `foundryup`
3. Install `argc`: `cargo install argc`
4. Install `solhint`: `npm ci`
5. Install `lcov` and `genhtml` (in order to support running coverage via `jib`)


NB: if you intend to run the scripts in `./script` directly or via `./bin/jib`, ensure you've created a `.envrc` file (`cp {example,}.envrc`), populated its values and exported them to your shell (`direnv` is a convenient way of managing this).

### Documentation

All documentation is in `NatSpec` format and available alongside the code. You can also generate the documentation for the project as HTML using the [`go-natspec`](https://github.com/sambacha/go-natspec) project. Here's a brief overview of usage on macOS:

```sh
$ brew install pygments
$ curl -O https://github.com/sambacha/go-natspec/releases/download/v0.0.1/dappspec
$ chmod +x dappspec
$ ./dappspec src/OrigamiGovernanceToken.sol
$ open docs/OrigamiGovernanceToken.sol
```

### Testing

Tests are implemented in Solidity and use `foundry` to power them. The documentation for writing tests using `foundry` is [thorough](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests) and there is an active community in their telegram.

The simplest test invocation is:

```sh
$ forge test
```

Running tests with 3 levels of verbosity provides extensive feedback on failures and gas usage estimates. Combining this with watch mode makes for a tight feedback loop:

```sh
$ forge test -vvv -w
```

### Coverage

Generate a coverage report:

```sh
$ ./bin/jib coverage
```

## Linting

Run the linter manually:

```sh
$ npx solhint src/**/*.sol
```

## Deploying

This is handled via the `jib` command (a jib is the arm that supports the load on a crane). The command self-documents by passing `--help` to its commands, as in:

```sh
$ ./bin/jib --help
```

or

```sh
$ ./bin/jib cmt --help
```

Some commands require the address of a previously deployed contract (e.g. the clone commands). Team members can find these on the notion page for deployed contract addresses.

## Local deployment on anvil

It may prove advantageous to deploy the entire suite of smart contracts locally for development purposes. To that end, we've created a `local-deploy` script that will deploy everything to a local node (here we use `anvil`, from the Foundry toolset).

The provided configuration file assumes that the account at index 19 from the `test test test test test test test test test test test junk` mnemonic was used to deploy the contracts. Additionally, the example commands that follow assume that the account at index 20 is set as the contract admin. Both of these accounts will need to be funded in your local node. A simple way to do so with `anvil` is:

```sh
$ anvil -a 21
```

The default behavior of `anvil` is to fund all accounts generated from the specified mnemonic.

### Deploy the contracts locally

To deploy the membership token, governance token, timelock controller, governor facets and governor diamond to a local node:

```sh
$ ./bin/jib local-deploy <ADDRESS CONTRACT-ADMIN> -p <PRIV KEY DEPLOYER>
```

### Configure the local governor instance

Provided you've used the specified account as the deployer, an example configuration file that uses the addresses that will have been generated by the above can be found at `configs/local-config.json`. If you did not use those accounts, you should update `configs/local-config.json` accordingly or use a different configuration file for the governor that specifies your generated contract addresses. Contract addresses are output during the `local-deploy` run.

The governor must be configured to use the facets in order to be used. You can do so with this command:

```sh
$ ./bin/jib cg -p <PRIVATE KEY OF CONTRACT ADMIN> <ADDRESS DIAMOND INIT> <ADDRESS OF THE GOVERNOR (DIAMOND)> <ADDRESS OF THE TIMELOCKCONTROLLER> <PATH TO JSON CONFIG>
```
